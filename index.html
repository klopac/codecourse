<h1 class= white-text> The Year I Learned To Code </h1>
<p class= white-text> Once Upon a time, I took a class.  It was called "Introduction to Computational Think and Coding" quite the mouthful, I know.  It wasn't meant to be more than an interesting speed bump on the road to getting a master's degree in education, but instead it has turned out to be some crazy Evil Kinevil trick that has launched me much further than I ever intended to go into the world of coding and technology.</p>
