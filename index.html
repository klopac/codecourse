<h1 class= white-text> The Year I Learned To Code </h1>
<p class= white-text> Once Upon a time, I took a class.  It was called "Introduction to Computational Think and Coding" quite the mouthful, I know.  It wasn't meant to be anything more than an interesting speed bump on the road to getting a master's degree in education. Instead, it has turned out to be some crazy Evil Kinevil trick that has launched me much further into the world of coding and technology than I ever intended to go.</p>

<p class= white-text>That picture would be even better if I could photoshop my face on there, but Photoshop is not the kind of technology I have been learning.  I started out learning with "Unplugged" activities (see <a href=http://csunplugged.org/>CSUnplugged</a> to learn more), then I learned <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/"> Scratch</a>, and <a href="https://processing.org/"> Processing</a>.  That was the end of course 1, and I was hooked.  So I moved on to Advanced Computational Thinking and Coding (still a mouthful) where I learned the <a href="https://create.arduino.cc/editor"> Arduino IDE</a> using the web editor, and hardware set-up basics, culminating with the posting of my own <a href="https://www.instructables.com/">Instructable</a> (I can't find my exact one). </p>
